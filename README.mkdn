# Coming soon

Forked from LineageOS
------------------

Patches are always welcome!  Please submit your patches via LineageOS Gerrit.
You can do this by using these commands:

    (From root android directory)
    . build/envsetup.sh
    (Go to repo you are patching, make your changes and commit)
    cmgerrit <for(new)/changes(patch set)> <branch/change-id>

    repo start fire-14.1 .
    (Make your changes and commit)
    repo upload .

Note: "." means the current directory
For more help on using this tool, use this command: `repo help upload`

Make your changes and commit with a detailed message, starting with what you are working with (i.e. "vision: Update Kernel")
Commit your patches in a single commit. Squash multiple commits using this command: `git rebase -i HEAD~<# of commits>`

To view the status of your and others' patches, visit [LineageOS Code Review](https://review.lineageos.org/)


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/FireLOS/android.git -b fire-14.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) for building instructions.
